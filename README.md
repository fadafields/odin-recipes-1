# odin-recipes-1
In this Odin-Recipes project, I will create a boilerplate webpage with a home page and a recipes page. This wil require me to use all the knowledge of webpage design I have learned to date. I'll have to create the proper directory structure on my local machine and create necessary html files to create the content of the webpage. This is my seconde time going through the Odin-Project from the beginning, I got sidetracked with work and life over the past 6 months. Even though I was familiar with the topics covered so far, I feel they are now becoming muscle memory and I can start to get deeper into the course and push to complete it. I'm looking forward to seeing how much easier creating this webpage of recipes will be this time around...hopefully!
